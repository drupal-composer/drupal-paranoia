# Drupal Paranoia
Composer plugin for improving the website security for composer-based Drupal websites by moving all __PHP files out of docroot__.

## Why use this Plugin?
The critical security issue with [Coder](https://www.drupal.org/project/coder) is a good example to consider moving PHP files outside of docroot:
- [SA-CONTRIB-2016-039 - Remote Code Execution](https://www.drupal.org/node/2765575)

## Requirements
Except for Windows, this plugin should work on environments that have Composer support. Do you use Windows? [Help us](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-paranoia/issues/5).

## Installation
Make sure you have a based [drupal-composer/drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project) project created.

Rename your current docroot directory to `/app`.
```
cd drupal-project-root
mv web app
```

Update the `composer.json` of your root package with the following values:
```json
"extra": {
    "drupal-paranoia": {
        "app-dir": "app",
        "web-dir": "web"
    },
    "installer-paths": {
        "app/core": ["type:drupal-core"],
        "app/libraries/{$name}": ["type:drupal-library"],
        "app/modules/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-module"],
        "app/profiles/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-profile"],
        "app/themes/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-theme"],
        "drush/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-drush"]
    }
}
```

Explaining:
- __/app__ folder: Drupal full installation.
- __/web__ folder: Will contain only symlinks of the assets files and PHP stub files (index.php, install.php, etc) from the `/app` folder.

Use `composer require ...` to install this Plugin on your project.
```
composer require drupal-composer/drupal-paranoia:~1
```

Done! The plugin and the new docroot are now installed.

### Asset file types
The asset files are symlinked from `/app` to `/web` folder.

Default asset file types are provided by the plugin:
```
robots.txt
.htaccess
*.css
*.eot
*.ico
*.gif
*.jpeg
*.jpg
*.js
*.map
*.otf
*.png
*.svg
*.ttf
*.woff
*.woff2
```

To extend the list of assets file types you can use the `asset-files` config:
```json
"extra": {
    "drupal-paranoia": {
        "app-dir": "app",
        "web-dir": "web",
        "asset-files": [
            "somefile.txt",
            "*.md"
        ]
    },
    "..."
}
```

If you need to modify the list you can use the `post-drupal-set-asset-file-types` event:
```json
"scripts": {
    "post-drupal-set-asset-file-types": [
        "DrupalProject\\composer\\ScriptHandler::setAssetFileTypes"
    ],
    "..."
},
```

```php
<?php

/**
 * @file
 * Contains \DrupalProject\composer\ScriptHandler.
 */

namespace DrupalProject\composer;

use DrupalComposer\DrupalParanoia\AssetFileTypesEvent;

class ScriptHandler {

  public static function setAssetFileTypes(AssetFileTypesEvent $event) {
    $asset_file_types = $event->getAssetFileTypes();
    // Do what you want with the asset file types.
    $event->setAssetFileTypes($asset_file_types);
  }

}
```

By the purpose of this plugin, the following files types are __not allowed__ and if listed they will be ignored:
```
*.inc
*.install
*.module
*.phar
*.php
*.profile
*.theme
```

### Exclude paths
With the drupal-paranoia option excludes, you can provide paths that should not be symlinked or stubbed to `/web` folder. The plugin provides no excludes by default.

```json
"extra": {
    "drupal-paranoia": {
        "app-dir": "app",
        "web-dir": "web",
        "excludes": [
            "core/install.php",
            "sites/simpletest"
        ]
    },
    "..."
}
```

__NOTE:__ Consider to exclude `/install.php` from your site. There are security concerns when this URL is publicly available, it can be used to create a list of contributed modules existing on the site.
You can exclude it via plugin as described above or via `.htaccess` rules.

### Web server docroot
Change the document root config of your web server to point to `/web` folder.

## Plugin events
This plugin fires the following named event during its execution process:

- __drupal-paranoia-post-command-run__: Occurs after the command `drupal:paranoia` is executed.

### Example of event subscriber

```php
<?php

namespace MyVendor;

use Composer\Composer;
use Composer\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;
use Composer\IO\IOInterface;
use Composer\Plugin\PluginInterface;
use DrupalComposer\DrupalParanoia\PluginEvents as DrupalParanoiaPluginEvents;

class MyClass implements PluginInterface, EventSubscriberInterface
{
    protected $composer;
    protected $io;

    public function activate(Composer $composer, IOInterface $io)
    {
        $this->composer = $composer;
        $this->io = $io;
    }

    public static function getSubscribedEvents()
    {
        return array(
            DrupalParanoiaPluginEvents::POST_COMMAND_RUN => 'postDrupalParanoiaCommand',
        );
    }

    public function postDrupalParanoiaCommand(CommandEvent $event) {
        // Add your custom action.
    }
}
```

## Local development
Every time you install or update a Drupal package via Composer, the `/web` folder will be recreated.

```
composer require drupal/devel:~1.0
> drupal-paranoia: docroot folder has been rebuilt.
```

When working with themes, CSS and JS for example, it may be necessary to rebuild the folder manually to symlink the new assets.
```
composer drupal:paranoia
```

### Public files
This plugin assumes that the public files folder exists at `app/sites/<site>/files` and symlinks `web/sites/<site>/files -> ../../../app/sites/<site>/files`.
